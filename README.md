# Teamwork
Teamwork is an app to help team leads stay on top of providing feedback, having 1-on-1's, and making sure their team members have what they need to do their best work.

## Disclaimer: This app isn't close to finished.

## üí°Idea/motivation
I started this passion project when I realized my time as team lead
could've been easier if there was a way to manage a few small
but important things more effectively.
      
Having an organized way to *keep track of feedback* for team members
and vice versa is critical in my opinion, and commonly used tools
like Slack, Jira, email, etc... aren't optimized for this.
      
Doing regular 1-on-1's is also key when it comes to running a great
team, and one common downfall of these meetings is forgetting to set
an agenda, and not *keeping track of any outcomes* from the meeting.
      
Lastly, while you're team lead there's always things you owe to each
team member, it could be explaining product requirements, following
up with your own manager, technical mentoring, etc... All of these
things don't really fit into Jira, and typically aren't accounted
for during sprints. It's easy to forget about these little things
that help your team be the best that it can be, and that's where
Teamwork comes in... well at least when I finish it.
